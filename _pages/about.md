An experienced bioinformatician/ biomedical data scientist with solid backgrounds in genetics, computer science, and statistics.

Currently, I am holding a research fellow position based in Norway where I actively do research in gene regulation inference and deep learning methods for genomics.

Past projects involved circular RNA, population-specific SNP array designs, and Polygenic risk scores where I was the lead developer of several novel high-performance computational methods.
